My personal fork of [Black Screen](https://github.com/vshatskyi/black-screen) containing a better theme, better name and icon and most importantly a much more awesome autocompletion

## What's it now currently?
Well it looks like something like this right now. But remember: I've just started tweaking the theme:

As you can see:
- Tab bar is bigger
- Search box has a round nice shape
- UI is Light and border less! (A smooth look)

And what's technically new?
- Autocompletion works with sequenced search keys. The architecture still doesn't support right ordering of the suggestion's but that's in mind
- `Enter` now runs the code, you don't have to do: `Tab` to add autocompletions and then do `Enter` one enter adds and runs. (This is very buggy due to some special software design behind it, so: working on it...)


## Legal
Black Screen was under MIT so this fork is more than completely legal!
